## A fictional company with altruistic goals

As the first project of the Full Stack Javascript Developer bootcamp - which is run by [karademy.ir](https://www.karademy.ir) - we were assigned to develop a website for a fictional company. We were mostly focused on responsive design and html structuring. I added two small snippet of js codes to menu button for smaller screen and also to add functionality to directional buttons for the featured section of the website in the first page.
